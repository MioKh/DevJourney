Well, that's what happens when you rely on an API that you don't have much control over.

The API that this project uses has been suspended by the developers. This is likely because it costs them money. I respect their work and wish them well. However, they didn't even publish the paid version of the API (not that I could afford it anyway).

I'll remove this from the main page and keep it here as a historical reference.
