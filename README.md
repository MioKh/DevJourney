# DevJourney

A repo for my learnings and projects using new skills

---

This repo is supposed to be about the stuff I am learning, but I skip a lot of stuff because I feel like I would look stupid or something like that. But I was thinking that if it's a self-learning repo to myself and maybe for people who see it, then why care? I should treat it like a diary. So from now on, I will try to add everything I am learning.

For example, I recognized that I kinda suck at converting designs into CSS and HTML, so I am taking the Frontend Mentor courses. Which kinda points you to web.dev to learn CSS and HTML. Even though I thought I knew those, a lot of the stuff I donâ€™t know I learned, like AOM, ARIA, what semantic HTML actually does for accessibility, a lot more about metadata stuff, open graph, and a lot of other things. But I never added them here or even talked about them that I learned them. So yeah, from now on, I will make maybe a separate folder of what I learned each day.

Or just make a file with some examples if they are very small after all you learn by making
