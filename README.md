# DevJourney

A repo for my learnings and projects using new skills

---

Well, I already do this on my own, so I thought why not make it public.
It also lets me share my learnings and projects with others,
and also it documents my journey as a developer.

But for now, I am not sure how to organize it properly.
Like should I make subfiles or just make it in one file and then write the code,
commit it, and then push it, then when I learn something new I delete the existing code
and write the newly learned stuff and then commit and push it.

I don't know, I am confused, I'll see what happens.

If I make some intresting project I'll make a seperate folder for it.
but for now i'll write everything it in one file.
