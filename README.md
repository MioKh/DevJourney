# DevJourney

A repo for my learnings and projects using new skills

---

Well, I already do this on my own, so I thought why not make it public.
It also lets me share my learnings and projects with others,
and also it documents my journey as a developer.

But for now, I am not sure how to organize it properly.
Like should I make subfiles or just make it in one file and then write the code,
commit it, and then push it, then when I learn something new I delete the existing code
and write the newly learned stuff and then commit and push it.

I don't know, I am confused, I'll see what happens.

If I make some intresting project I'll make a seperate folder for it.
but for now i'll write everything it in one file.


So it's been a while but trust me I was learning in those days you can see it in the repo as well.
I didnt upload stuff cause It wasnt really uploadable ? if that make sense 

currently learning react like activley i'll see what happens. and maybe make some projects using it 
also learning tailwind css cause i am not that good with design.

anyway I'll be testing like finding dominant color in an image for my other Anime fetching api thing project i am doing https://miokh.github.io/Animio i was planing on adding a backdrop image but I couldnt find a good api to find the images dynamically so i thought will might aswell do like spotify does to their playlist thing 

also i was going through fullstackopen course and its very good
