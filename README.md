# DevJourney

A repo for my learnings and projects using new skills

---

Well, I already do this on my own, so I thought why not make it public.
It also lets me share my learnings and projects with others,
and also it documents my journey as a developer.

Well funny how I still dont really know hwo to orginize this repo cause like some stuff you dont know weather you should push them or not but I will stop thinking about that and just push everything 

Also I did take a bit of a break from programming life was a mess so I was a bit not consistent with uploading stuff although I was learning 

anyway as you can see I kinda think I suceeded with the Spotify playlist general image color thing in the [DominantColor](https://miokh.github.io/DevJourney/projects//DominantColor/domColor.html) but I still dont know how to fix the cors proplem 

I actually kinda forgot about the [Animio](https://miokh.github.io/Animio/) project and that I didnt finish it ._. like I was so in fun with the fact I got it working I forgot that I should add pagination

Anyway since I am back on track I am still in the odin project , while looking at ossu and the fullstackopen
